Primite 1.02 – Artificial Cognition System,  JN Research (Dubai, UAE)

This repository contains supporting material for Primite 1.02, an artificial cognitive system built using Adaptrons - artificial neurons that exhibit:
• Subthreshold potentials  
• Graded potentials  
• Action potentials  
Unlike machine learning models, Adaptrons operate on principled neuron-like rules and adapt internally and with each other. From these dynamics, higher cognitive functions emerge naturally.

What’s unique about Primite 1.02?
Primite 1.02 (500 Adaptrons) is the first working prototype of an artificial brain that demonstrates:  
• Original Thought: outputs never given as stimuli produced autonomously.  
• Memory Formation & Recall: memories of stimuli and self-generated thoughts, recalled across short, intermediate, and long-term spans.  
• Anticipation: outputs appear before the corresponding input stimulus is presented.  

Reports & Outputs:
• Technical Report: Primite 1.02 (PDF)  
• Experimental Outputs   
• Prior Blogs: Primite 1.01, Adaptron overview  
All outputs are raw for independent verification.

Methodology Overview:
• No machine learning or gradient descent.  
• Only fundamental neuron-like rules are preprogrammed.  
• Behavior emerges from interactions and genetic parameters (configurations controlling adaptability).  
• One control experiment set system as a pure input-output machine → no higher functions emerged, confirming adaptability is key.  

Live Demos:
We are open to external verification via live demos: reviewers choose inputs, observe outputs in real time, and confirm activity. For deeper reviews (e.g., genetic parameters), NDAs may be required.
